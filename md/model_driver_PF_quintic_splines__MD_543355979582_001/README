This directory (model_driver_PF_qunitic_splines) contains a EAM-like
Model driver written in Fortran 90.
See Reference: Chiesa et al., J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 23 (2011) 206001
For details of functional forms


It complies with the KIM API interface standard, using any NBC and iterator or
locator mode, publishes its parameters, and supports optional computation of
`energy', `forces', `particleEnergy', `process_dEdr', and `process_dE2dr2'.
Its initializaton routine takes a KIM API object pointer and a pointer to a
string that contains the cutoff and Lennard-Jones parameters which define a KIM
Model based on this KIM Model Driver.

To create a KIM Model from this Model Driver, a parameter file is required.
This file must have the follwing format:
   Line 1: `cutoff' value in angstroms
   Line 2: number of pair potential knot point, number of rho density knot points, logical flag to determine
   whether the lambda pre-factor for knot functions is constant or varying with knot point
   Line 3: dummy integer, sqrt(rho) pre-factor for embedding function, dummy logicaal
   Line 4: dummy integer, pre-factor for magnetic part of embedding function (zero for non-magnetic cases), dummy logical
   Line 5+: line per density knot point: dummy integer, i'th knot coefficient, dummy logical, i'th knot point, dummy logical
   Line per pair potential knot point - same format as density knot points
   If single lambda, then global lambda for density knot points followed by global lambda for pair-part knot points
   ELSE: line per density knot point: idummy, lambda i phi, ldummy
   then line per pair knot point: same format.
   last line - text descriptor for potential.

    This file

model_driver_PF_quintic_splines.F90
    Fortran 90 file that contains the implementation of the
    potential Model Driver

model_driver_PF_quintic_splines.kim.tpl
    Template KIM descriptor file containing all variables and methods that are
    exposed by the driver through the KIM API interface.  This file will be
    used (by the make system) to generate a KIM descriptor file for each KIM
    Model based on this Model Driver.
