== eam_db.tdb format ==
- Rcutoff value for elements is in column 8-12 of the each second
line as 'f5.2' format.
- Rcutoff value for alloys is in column 51-55 of the each second line
as 'f5.2' format.
- Rcutoff value for ternary is in column 36-40 of the each second
line as 'f5.2' format.
- Rcutoff value for multicomponent higher than ternary can be read
from additional part, see line 146.

== Description ==

This file contains the parameters for 2NN MEAM interatomic potential.
The file name should be "eam_db.tdb". The latest version of this file
can be obtained at http://cmse.postech.ac.kr/. This file consisted of
four parts, the first is parameters for elements, the second for
alloys(binary systems), the third for ternary systems and the fourth
is cutoff distance for multicomponent system higher than ternary.

1) Element parameters

The parameter set of each element would be read as fixed format of
two lines by program. You can check details about these parameters
from the reference[Lee B-J, Baskes MI. Physical Review B
2000;62:8564-8567].

2) Alloy parameters

The parameter set of each element would be read as fixed format of
two lines by program. Some parameters(Re, B, Cmin, Cmax) can be
determined to default value automatically by giving zero value or you
can determine them empirically. The default value depends on
reference structure. Please check the references about 2NN MEAM of
binary system represented in the end of eam_db.tdb file.

3) Ternary parameters

For ternary system, three more ternary parameters for each screening,
Cmin(i-j-k) and Cmax(i-j-k), are necessary. This parameters can be
assumed from Cmin and Cmax of binary system. You can confirm that
from the reference[Kim H-K, Jung W-S, Lee B-J. Acta materialia
2009;57:3140-3147].

4) Multicomponent higher than ternary
In this case, the parameters are unnecessary. You can give a proper
cutoff distance for your multicomponent system.
