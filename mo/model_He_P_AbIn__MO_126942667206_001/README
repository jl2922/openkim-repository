This directory (model_He_P_AbIn) contains an ab initio ground state He+He pair potential.
The potential comprises of two parts:

1) Ab Initio well and dispersion potential for separation distances > ~2a0 which was given
by

Bich E., Hellmann R., and Vogel E. 2007. Ab initio potential energy curve for the helium atom
pair and thermophysical properties of the dilute helium gas. Mol. Phys. 105.

2) For separation distances < ~2a0 a screened coloumb potential was fit to the ab initio potential.
This screened potential is such that the potentials and its derivatives are smooth.
