This directory (Three_Body_Stillinger_Weber_Balamane_Si__MO_113686039439_002) contains Balamane et al rescaled
Stillinger-Weber potential Model based on the KIM Model Driver Three_Body_Stillinger_Weber.
This Model implements the Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential for Si with a rescaled value
of epsilon parameter used in the SW potential. The original epsilon value was
2.1682 eV [Ref 1]. Balamane et al [Ref 2, 3] rescaled it to 2.315 eV so that
experimental cohesive energy E_coh = 4.63 eV can be obtained. The original SW
potential gives E_coh = 4.3364 eV.

The following files are in this directory:

Three_Body_Stillinger_Weber_Balamane_Si.params

  first line: 1 (number of species)

  Then the following 9 parameters:
  A(in ev) B p q sigma(in Angstrom) lambda(in eV) gamma(in Angstorm) costheta_0 cutoff

  Any additional lines will be silently ignored.

The functional form of the SW potential is rewritten as:

  E = sum_{i,j>i} phi_2(rij) + sum_{i, j!=i, k>j} phi_3(rij, rik, theta)

  phi_2(rij)           = Aij*(Bij(rij/sigma_ij)^(-p) - (rij/sigma_ij)^(-q))
                         * exp(sigma_ij/(rij - rcutij))

  phi_3(rij,rik,theta) = lambda_ijk(cos[theta] - cos[theta0])^2
                         *  exp(gamma_ij/(rij - rcutij) + gamma_ik/(rik - rcutik))
  
Compared to the standard SW potential, the following redefinitions have been made:
  A      := A*epsilon
  lambda := lambda*epsilon
  gamma  := gamma*sigma
  rcut   := a*sigma
