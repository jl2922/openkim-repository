This directory (Pair_Morse_Modified_MacDonaldMacDonald_Cu__MO_034823476734_000)
contains a modified Morse Model due to MacDonald and MacDonald.
It complies with the KIM API library, supporting all NBCs and Locator
and Iterator mode, and publishes its parameters, and supports optional
computation of `energy', `forces', `particleEnergy', and `virial'.

Detail information about the potentials can be found at:
MacDonald, Rosemary A. and MacDonald, William M. "Thermodynamic properties
of fcc metals at high temperatures." Physical Review B 24.4 (1981): 1715.
