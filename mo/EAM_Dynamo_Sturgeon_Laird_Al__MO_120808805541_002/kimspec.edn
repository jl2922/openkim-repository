{"description" "This EAM model for Al is based on the model developed by Mei-Davenport, which we have optimized to give the correct experimental melting temperature"
 "disclaimer" "This model was developed as a prototype case for the Gibbs-Duhem protocol for optimizing melting points. As such, the melting point was the primary metric for its development. We have shown that the modifications to the original Mei-Davenport potential that we used to optimize T_m did not change the quality of the potential with respect to elastic constants, density, etc., but no systematic study of other properties was performed."
