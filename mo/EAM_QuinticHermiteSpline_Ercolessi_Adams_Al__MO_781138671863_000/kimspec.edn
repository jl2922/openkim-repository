{"description" "This is an EAM_Dynamo parameterization for pure aluminum due to F. Ercolessi and J. B. Adams. The potential was developed using the \"force-matching method\", which includes forces from first-principles calculations in the fitting data base. The potential was fitted to properties of face-centered cubic (fcc) crystals."
 "disclaimer" "By design, this potential is not expected to be accurate for geometries with extremely low coordination -- such as small molecules -- which were not included in the input set."
