This directory (Three_Body_Stillinger_Weber_Zhang_Silicene_Model2_Si__MO_475612090600_002)
contains a parameterization of the Stillinger-Weber potential [1] optimized for 
Silicene (single-layer Si sheets) [2] based on the KIM Model Driver 
Three_Body_Stillinger_Weber.  According to the authors, the potential
"accurately reproduces the low buckling structure of silicene and the full phonon dispersion curves obtained from ab initio calculations" [2]. 
The authors provide two sets of parameters. This parameterization corresponds 
to the parameter set referred to as "Optimized SW2" in [2].

The following files are in this directory:

Three_Body_Stillinger_Weber_Zhang_Silicene_Model2_Si.params

  first line: 1 (number of species)

  Then the following 9 parameters:
  A(in ev) B p q sigma(in Angstrom) lambda(in eV) gamma(in Angstorm) costheta_0 cutoff

  Any additional lines will be silently ignored.

The functional form of the SW potential is rewritten as:

  E = sum_{i,j>i} phi_2(rij) + sum_{i, j!=i, k>j} phi_3(rij, rik, theta)

  phi_2(rij)           = Aij*(Bij(rij/sigma_ij)^(-p) - (rij/sigma_ij)^(-q))
                         * exp(sigma_ij/(rij - rcutij))

  phi_3(rij,rik,theta) = lambda_ijk(cos[theta] - cos[theta0])^2
                         *  exp(gamma_ij/(rij - rcutij) + gamma_ik/(rik - rcutik))
  
Compared to the standard SW potential, the following redefinitions have been made:
  A      := A*epsilon
  lambda := lambda*epsilon
  gamma  := gamma*sigma
  rcut   := a*sigma
